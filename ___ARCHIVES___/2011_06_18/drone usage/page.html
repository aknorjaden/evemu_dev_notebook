<title>Drone Usage</title>
</head><body><span style="font-family: Nokia Sans">*** TODO ***<br/>
* Need to inherit InventoryItem to create a new item class Drone<br/>
* We need &nbsp;a drone manager to handle the client calls for launching and contrrolling drones, much like an AI, so could this just inheirit from NPCAI or be different altogether? &nbsp;DroneEntity should inheirit from this new DroneAI class<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
== &nbsp; &nbsp; COMPLETED &nbsp; &nbsp; ==<br/>
====================<br/>
* DONE - fix Client::ScoopDrone() to actually transfer drone to drone bay or cargo bay, missing some kind of update to tell client that cargo/drone bay contents changed, look at code that moves items in and out of cargo containers - ADDED CHANGE OWNER TO PLAYER<br/>
* NOT NEEDED SINCE SCOOPDRONE WORKS NOW - obtain correct packet returns to the client for scooping a drone from space to either cargo (ShipBound::Scoop) or drone bay (ShipBound::ScoopDrone)<br/>
