<title>EVEmu Control Panel</title>
</head><body><span style="font-family: Nokia Sans">The EVEmu Control Panel is the application used by the server administrator to facilitate many features and maintenance functions of the game. &nbsp;The desired functions are listed below:<br/>
<br/>
* Send system wide messages to all clients informing them of important events such as imminent down-time<br/>
* Set the default login message, if any, to inform users logging in of any important info<br/>
* Initiate a down-time save-off of all loaded InventoryItem objects' attribute and other DB info so it gets written back to the DB. &nbsp;This will ensure a complete snapshot of the entire gameworld at that moment.<br/>
