<br/>
+++ The Wormhole Drive +++<br/>
Kinda like a stargate from the Stargate:SG1 show, where a wormhole opens up to an intended target system be it either a W-space system or a designated K-space system. &nbsp;We could hijack a current module like the jump drive and make new entries in the DB for it, then use force field password to "set" the target system by name or locus signature. &nbsp;When activated, the wormhole entry point is created, but the wormhole drive-carrying ship cannot move until the module is disengaged and the current cycle completes, but the wormhole entry point stays active until then allowing ships to come out and go in. &nbsp;When module deactivates, the wormhole drive-carrying ship has 30sec to enter wormhole before despawn. &nbsp;To make this item of strategic and tactical importance and risk balanced, make the ship have to run out a full cycle once before the wormhole opens up, so at least the ship and others are vulnerable while waiting for the first cycle to complete. &nbsp;Make the cycle time kinda long, say 1 minute or maybe 5, and use some advanced science skill to reduce the cycle time by 10% per level.<br/>
<br/>
+++ Ship Explosions Do Damage to Nearby Ships Regardless of Friend/ Foe +++<br/>
This would be very realistic to make ship explosions dispense damage to nearby ships, proportional to how close they are at the time of the explosion with the damage amount dropping off with distance according to the inverse square law. &nbsp;Ship capacitor amount would translate into half Thermal half EM damage along with any loaded cap booster charges and charges in cargo "selected" for destruction, ship mass would translate into kinetic damage, and loaded missiles/bombs and any missiles/bombs in cargo "selected" for destruction rather than loot drop would translate into explosive damage.<br/>
