<title>Incursion Client Support</title>
</head><body><span style="font-family: Nokia Sans">*** MOVE EVEMU TO SUPPORT INCURSION CLIENT ***<br/>
<br/>
*** NEED TO DO BIG PACKET CAPTURE PARTY SOON AND GET THAT CLIENT VERSION SAVED OFF IN ORDER TO SPEND MONTHS TO YEARS CONTINUING TO IMPROVE FEATURE SUPPORT FOR THAT VERSION.<br/>
<br/>
*** PROBLEMS ***<br/>
* Need new charUnboundMgr service<br/>
* Need a web server that serves char portraits to clients as CCP's http://images.cdn1.eveonline.com, see that URL for info on how it works. &nbsp;We need our own server that acts as this one does and also allows users to submit their own avatar pictures since we cannot create the images ourselves from the new char creation info. &nbsp;One suggestion would be to create the avatar you want on a trial of eve live, then save the images and use those to upload to the evemu image server.<br/>
