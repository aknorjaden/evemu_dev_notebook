<title>LSC Chat System</title>
</head><body>&gt;*** PROBLEMS ***<br/>
* For some reason, when a user-created channel is created, only super-admin/GM players can chat in them, normal players cannot. &nbsp;I suspect it has to do with a permissions thingy as the client probably thinks that the channel will no allow anyone to chat in it.<br/>
* LSCService::Handle_Configure()<br/>
 &nbsp;- This handles setting ALL channel settings, permissions, moderators, MoTD, etc<br/>
<br/>
* INCURSION: when 2nd 3rd, etc chars login, all other chars in station guests, local, and chat channels have no name. &nbsp;we traced this to the fact that the response packet sent by the JoinChannels call is quite different<br/>
