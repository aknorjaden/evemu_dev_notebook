***** IMPORTANT *****<br/>
- we MUST add checks inside DestinyManager class to check if m_self is a client derived object BEFORE using CastToClient() in order to work with docking maneuvers<br/>

*** UPDATE - NOVEMBER 2012 ***<br/>
* Stranho has returned and is working on NPC systems<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;he has made some fixes and reports that NPC ships move, follow,target attack, and do damage !<br/>
 &nbsp; - issues<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ attempting to target an NPC ship results in a client exception and the NPC ship disappearing<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;in space only, overview still shows NPC ship but at distance of -1.$<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ I've approved his pull req. and rebuilt the server, but the NPC ships disappear to -1.$ distance<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;immediately when they start targeting ME<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- track down the packet sent to MY client when NPC ship starts targeting ME<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ we have NO spawn groups or spawns defined in our DB tables at all<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ <br/>
<br/>

*** BASIC NPC ACTIONS AND SYSTEMS USED TO IMPLEMENT THEM ***<br/>
* Movement<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DestinyManager<br/>
<br/>
* Targeting<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- TargetingManager<br/>
<br/>
* Strategic and Tactical decision making<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- NPC AI<br/>

*** MAJOR SYSTEMS USING NPC SHIPS ***<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_JoveIncursion<br/>
* IN ALL NPC SYSTEMS: On very rare occaisions, you may get a Jove spawn with Jove &nbsp;modules, skill books, even Jove BPCs<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_BeltSpawns<br/>
* Belt spawns: region specific pirate faction ships with more valable ship/loot the lower the system's security status; random small fleet configurations of frigates, cruisers, battleships<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ named officer spawns randomly appear with these small fleets and drop BPO/BPC and faction loot, modules, ammo, etc<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_Convoys<br/>
* Trader traffic carrying random goods between systems and stations using industrials, transports, and freighters, more valuable cargo the lower the system's security status, less volume of traffic the lower the system's security status; random seeds of valuable cargo more likely in freighters, even more in transports; random seeds of ore shipments in any of these haulers based on available ore in the surrounding areas, as these haulers would have a flight plan starting in a pseudo-random system w/ a station or NPC POS (yes, random placement of attackable NPC POSes) and ending in another random system w/ station or NPC POS making a random jump count along the path<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ extension: make them accept courier contracts so you can use these NPC haulers to ship stuff around for you ;)<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_Mining<br/>
* Mining ships either solo or in varying sized fleets and cinfigurations including Retreivers, Covetors, Hulks, Mackinaws, Orcas, and ven Rorquals will be at various belts and in null-sec, they will more often be at anomaly or signature sites<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_POS_Management<br/>
* NPC POS installations in low- and null-sec systems, random race towers and configurations; more frequently spawned the lower the security status, also the more 'beefy' the POS configuration will be<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- when you take down shields of the POS, you can take it over using a code breaker with 1 in<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 200 chance of breaking the code, but once you dco, all batteries stop firing and ownership<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transfers to you<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: NPC_CONCORD_GateSec<br/>
CLASS: NPC_CONCORD_StationSec<br/>
CLASS: NPC_CONCORD_CrimeResponse<br/>
* CONCORD - navy faction fitted CONCORD ships with some empire specific battleships at stargates and some NPC stations in high-sec, small groups at stargates in medium-sec, and few on some stargates in low-sec, gate guns on all gates in high-, medium-, and low-sec systems, small force detatchments spawned when non-war dec'd players attacked by other players warping into position and attacking offending ship(s)<br/>
<br/>
CLASS: ???<br/>
* EVEMU Incursions: weighted-random spawns of pirate faction or rarely sansha or jove battlegroups of various fleet configurations at random places in system: gates (w/ bubble), stations (w/ bubble), belts, etc. &nbsp;when these happen, randomly lock down gate travel until spawn is cleared forcing players to deal with this random "fun"<br/>
<br/>
