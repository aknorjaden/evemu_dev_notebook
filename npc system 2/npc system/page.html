*** MAJOR SYSTEMS USING NPC SHIPS ***<br/>
* IN ALL NPC SYSTEMS: On very rare occaisions, you may get a Jove spawn with Jove &nbsp;modules, skill books, even Jove BPCs<br/>
* Belt spawns: region specific pirate faction ships with more valable ship/loot the lower the system's security status; random small fleet configurations of frigates, cruisers, battleships<br/>
* Trader traffic carrying random goods between systems and stations using industrials, transports, and freighters, more valuable cargo the lower the system's security status, less volume of traffic the lower the system's security status; random seeds of valuable cargo more likely in freighters, even more in transports; random seeds of ore shipments in any of these haulers based on available ore in the surrounding areas, as these haulers would have a flight plan starting in a pseudo-random system w/ a station or NPC POS (yes, random placement of attackable NPC POSes) and ending in another random system w/ station or NPC POS making a random jump count along the path<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ extension: make them accept courier contracts so you can use these NPC haulers to ship stuff around for you ;)<br/>
* NPC POS installations in low- and null-sec systems, random race towers and configurations; more frequently spawned the lower the security status, also the more 'beefy' the POS configuration will be<br/>
* CONCORD - navy faction fitted CONCORD ships with some empire specific battleships at stargates and some NPC stations in high-sec, small groups at stargates in medium-sec, and few on some stargates in low-sec, gate guns on all gates in high-, medium-, and low-sec systems, small force detatchments spawned when non-war dec'd players attacked by other players warping into position and attacking offending ship(s)<br/>
* EVEMU Incursions: weighted-random spawns of pirate faction or rarely sansha or jove battlegroups of various fleet configurations at random places in system: gates (w/ bubble), stations (w/ bubble), belts, etc. &nbsp;when these happen, randomly lock down gate travel until spawn is cleared forcing players to deal with this random "fun"<br/>
<br/>
*** TODO ***<br/>
* design a generic class wrapper containing a Lua embedded interpreter and some standard functions used to work with the interpreter and allow tieing into lua with c++ functions and getting output from lua scripts<br/>
* use the SWIG tool to build lua tables of class functions for Ship, ModuleManagersddddrddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd{¿dddddddddddd&gt;&lt;).__`¨*````</body></html>
