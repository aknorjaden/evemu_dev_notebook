*** NPC AI ALGORITHMS ***<br/>
<br/>
* Basic AI:<br/>
(1) request list of targets in current bubble<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- list of entityIDs and distance to NPC fleet commander operating the AI script<br/>
(2) filter targets by distance to get subset of targets in-range<br/>
(3) choose a target, wait 15sec, then order NPC fleet to engage the selected target<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; if targeting unsuccessul, then order ships to move into range and engage<br/>
(4) when target is destroyed, go to step (1)<br/>
--- Requirements from Lua class for bound functions C++ --&gt; Lua and Lua --&gt; C++<br/>
- Call OUT to C++ RequestTargetList() - returns array of entityID(int), distance(real) INTO Lua environment<br/>
- Call OUT to C++ EngageTarget(int entityID)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*** ULTIMATE SCENARIO ***<br/>
- This scenario should play out all exciting NPC behaviors to flush out all possible sources of data and actions to be taken by an NPC AI script<br/>
-- npc fleet warps into engagement zone as directed or in response to arrival of hostile ship(s)<br/>
-- platoons are dispatched to station, belts, gates to set bubbles and camps<br/>
-- scans are inittiated to search for POS installations, anomaly sites, signature sites, and wormholes<br/>
-- scouts (could be cloaked) are dispatched to POS, anomaly, signature sites to discover any awaiting hostiles ripe for engagement<br/>
-- arranging battle squads:<br/>
 &nbsp;-- DPS: close range / long range sniper<br/>
 &nbsp;-- logistics: shield / armor<br/>
 &nbsp;-- scouts: frigates, interceptors, cov-ops, cloaky<br/>
 &nbsp;-- fast tackle: frigates, interceptors, fast faction cruisers<br/>
-- when hostile ships are found:<br/>
 &nbsp;-- review hostile ship list for these characteristics and choose one of more strategies to employ:<br/>
 &nbsp;-- weakest link: find ship with lowest shield/armor, focus fire to destroy - rinse, repeat<br/>
 &nbsp;-- logistics must die: find first closest logistics class ship, focus fire <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

*** ESSENTIAL DATA STRUCTURES AND FUNCTIONS ***<br/>
* Target List<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- FIELDS: entityID, typeID, groupID, rangeToTarget, shieldLevel, armorLevel, <br/>
