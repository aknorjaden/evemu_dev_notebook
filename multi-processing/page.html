</head><body>*** EVEMU IS A SINGLE PROCESS WITH NO MULTI-THREADING ***<br/>
*** HOW DO WE FIX THIS ??? ***<br/>
<br/>
*** IDEAS ***<br/>
* spawn eve-server.exe for each solar system? each region?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- how does each process communicate with another that it needs to? some connection router process?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- how do data structures get passed to other instances? &nbsp;for whole characters when they jump?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- how do chats span across multiple instances when characters span the galaxy?<br/>
* spawn eve-server.exe to serve different functions, api-only server, char image-only server, full single server, non-api and non-image server, etc<br/>
<br/>
*** INTER-PROCESS COMMUNICATION (ICP) ***<br/>
* use cross platform standard library for Internet sockets so that multiple processes can communicate regardless if they are on they same machine or are separated by an ethernet connection<br/>
<br/>
*** Cluster Design ***<br/>
* first, see Luck's diagrams on wiki.evemu.org/<br/>
