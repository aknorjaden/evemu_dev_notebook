*** \o/ &nbsp;Luck has re-designed and coded nearly the entire ModuleManager framework ***<br/>
*** LET'S GET BUSY !!! ****<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*** NOTES ON CONTINUING MODULE MANAGER AND SHIP COMBAT DEVELOPMENT ***<br/>
* EXPERIMENT: run two clients in space, set a one-time halving of ship shields attribute with notify when ship is set to STOP in BeyonceBound and observe effect from own ship and other ship while targeting the ship whose shield dropped<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- note everything that happens, we're kinda screwed if this does not work because that will<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mean that there are one or more packets just missing in the whole series involving any situation<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; involving ANY Passive or Active Module since every action by a module has some effect on<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; either the fitted ship or a targeted object<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ my ship showed change to shields when i stopped it<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ other ship saw no change to shields when i stopped while it targetted me<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;*** CONCLUSION: Perhaps not as bad as i thought since damage and changes to ship and module attributes require OnDamageStateChange, OnGodmaShipEffect, OnModuleAttributeChange as well as these: NotEnoughEnergy, OnEffectHit, OnDamageMessage which all get put into DoDestinyUpdate packets<br/>
* OBSERVATION: collisions are NOT even discovered nor handled in DestinyManager, so that is something we need to do<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*** SHIP EXPLOSIONS: Just for fun, implement /kill &lt;entityID&gt; command to remove ball, delete item, and send DoDestinyUpdate with "TerminalExplosion"<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ DONE - add a /kill &lt;entityID&gt; method to GMCommands.cpp<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ DONE - test and debug updates to &nbsp;TerminalExplosion section to DoDestinyUpdates<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ make a Ship::Kill() method that does most of the code now inside GMCommand's /kill<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- is this already inside Damage.cpp ? &nbsp; how about for NPC class ships?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ if killed ship has an operator that owns a character object, then cause char to disembark ship into<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a capsule, then explode ship and delete it<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ can we provide a live update to the client that makes explosions more spectacular?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- get oza and caytchen to take a look at this<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ SPECTACULAR: an idea on how to make ship explosions in eve more spectacular<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- find a few different wrecks, structures, etc that can be spawned at random positions near and along the real hull, then start exploding those at random intervals thus extending by a great deal the process by which the ship shows itself explodingfrom stern to bow, or from core drive to bow<br/>
<br/>

*** DOCUMENTATION ***<br/>
* find a tool that will automatically create class diagrams<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ VisualParadigm should do the trick, just run it once a month on those class groups, update wiki<br/>
* create class diagram for major evemu classes<br/>
* create class diagrrams for key systems of classes<br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- PROBLEM: one effectID may affect more than one attribute, so, how do we fill data for the<br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is modify-consume for each cycle of an Active module? &nbsp;this would not apply to passives.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-- SOLUTION: move the field(s) describing maintain/consume behavior of effect to the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dgmEffectsInfo table so that they are tied to each target attribute to be modified<br/>

* FORGET THE WIKI, Oza is doing this now at my request on his Gork Admin site:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- web.gork.levelbelow.net<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- we can import the current CCP dumps into mysql running our wiki.....so if we did,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; can we do queries on those tables and display query reults in a wiki page using<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; one or more wiki templates, extensions, or both<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- it would be nice to provide some wiki templates such as these:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Attribute, Effect, Type, Group, Category, Station, Entity, etc to lookup their info<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- should this be done using EVEmu Web Portal intead?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
************************************<br/>
* TEST / BUG FIX - POST-DATA ENTRY:<br/>
************************************<br/>
* UPDATE ALL AREAS where Missing attributes are added to attribute maps of Ship, NPC, etc class objects to add those same attributes with their default values to the Default Attribute Map<br/>
<br/>
* IMPLEMENT GetDefaultAttribute() &nbsp;methods on InventoryItem, Ship, etc classes<br/>
<br/>
* MAKE STUBS for ALL MISSING server calls new in Crucible<br/>
<br/>
* MAKE WORK flagAutoFit functionality<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- study server call that is invoked upon attempting to auto-fit a module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- need method to call on Ship -&gt; ModuleManager -&gt; ModuleContainer to find an unused slot<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on the same bank as the module would be fitted to --- must query module effects for slot ID<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- with new flag value, begin normal fitting procedures<br/>
<br/>
* FIX the fact that Module Online/Offline state is somehow not stored/loaded from the database<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- first check to see if a log off or server restart is needed to reproduce this problem<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- whenever i log off with modules fitted and onlined, then log back in, the modules are offline<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- check to see if onlining is working correctly i the server as well as database and packets to client<br/>
 <br/>
* RESEARCH PACKET LOGS for MODULES: Review all actions of a Passive module as captured in eve live packet capture logs (INCURSION and CRUCIBLE)and note each packet type and outer structure and the Service Call to the server that was made<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Fit module (automatic online subsequent to fitting provided sufficient cpu &amp; power)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Unfit module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Online module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Offline module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Activate module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Deactivate module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Overload module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Load Charge into module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Unload Charge from module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ Reload Charge into module<br/>
<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE - IMPORTANT: Fix PasswordModule.cpp's GeneraePasswordHas() from crashing<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;----&gt; re-test API Server calls w/ EFT and EVEmon<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- test loading of database info from all new dgmXXX tables into the Singleton-derived memory<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; objects<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- test linkages from actual ship, module, and skill instance objects to these singleton objects<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- start implementing some test case uses of attribute bonuses and make test calculations with them<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- start implementing the reverse calculations of these same bonuses when modules are<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; unfitted/offlined or ship is disembarked<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;-OR-<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- implement effective reversal of module, ship, skill modifications by applying default attribute to<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the dynamic attribute map and recalculate the entire modifier from scratch whenever the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set of modifiers for an attribute is changed<br/>
<br/>
* TEST/DEMO: can you quickly code up capability forr a bunch of modules to show GFX effects?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- make ActiveModule class put itself online properly then on Activate, send gfx effect pkt<br/>
<br/>
* EXPAND: ModuleContainer needs another std:mEW - std::map&lt;Ev to a ship?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- comparison of live crucible logs to sisi incarna logs reveal:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ live sends 'OnItemsChanged', evemu sendppens on fittting a module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE Nen flag value is 'in space'<br/>
<br/>
* EXPAND: ModuleContainer needs another std:mEW - std::map&lt;Ev to a ship?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- comparison of livs 'OnItemChanged', notice the plural on live<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ live sends 'OnItemsChanged' once for change of inventory, then a second for change in flag<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ NEXT - ShipGetInfo response by evemu server does not match eve live's 'util.KeyVal' structure<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;+ FIXED - client calls ItemGetInfo, live returns a 'util.KeyVal' packet, evemu returns a 'util.Row'<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;packet of a rather different format<br/>
<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- make use of this container whap,. using itemID as key, not flag, to allow POS modules to use the ModuleManager class when instantiated on a control tower<br/>
<br/>
* CAPTURE: get eve live packets for onlining and offlining modules while in space. &nbsp;Use TWO characters with one targeting the other and on/off-line 1600mm plates<br/>
* COMPARE: identify any differences between crucible/incursion logs when fitting, unfitting, onlining, and offlining. &nbsp;then, itemize work items here:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- ?<br/>
<br/>
* IMPLEMENT: PassiveModule: code up the changes in module state that will be needed when effects processing is implemented.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - std::map&lt;EvilNumber, ModifierRef&gt; ModifierMap<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - std::map&lt;uint32 attributeID, ModifierMap * modiifierMap&gt; ModifierMaps<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - need a std::map&lt;&gt; of class objects for storing these values:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1. (uint32) target attribute ID<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. (uint32) targetID (self, charges, other modules onboard, ship, external target)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3. (EvilNumber) modifier value<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4. (uint32) calculation type ID<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5. (uint32) reverse calculation type ID<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW &nbsp;need 'dirty' booleans for each modifier map (one for each attributeID)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 'dirty' = true means MM should recalculate modifiers of that attribute<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---&gt; need new class ModifierMap to contain actual map and the dirty flag<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - std::map&lt;uint32 attributeID, Modifier * modifierRef&gt; SubsystemModifiers<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - std::map&lt;uint32 attributeID, Modifier * modifierRef&gt; SkillModifiers<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONEe NEW - std::map&lt;uint32 attributeID, Modifier * modifierRef&gt; ModuleRigModifiers<br/>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;- DONE NEW - int32 RemoveRemoteEffect(uint32 attributeID, ModifierRef mod)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- NEW - int32 GetEffec<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- module modifiers, ship bonuses, skill bonuses, and implant bonuses are all accumulated<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; according to the following rules:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** Negative affecting modules/rigs are accounted separately from positive affecting modules<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when applying stacking penalties AND their negative effects are applied AFTER all<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;positive effects are applied<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** ALL ABSOLUTE VALUE ATTRIBUTE MODIFIERS ARE APPLIED FIRST AND W/O STACKING<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;PENALTIES APPLIED AT ALL. &nbsp;SCREEN EACH MODIFIER IN A MODIFIER MAP FOR AN<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ATTRIBUTE FOR CALC TYPES THAT INDICATE ABSOLUTE VALUE MODIFIERS:<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - simple straight addition<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - simple straight subtraction<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** POWER and CPU never have stacking penalties applied to any modifiers affecting them<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - CHECK for an attribute of modules the presence of which indicates penalties apply<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Add new var to Modifier class 'm_bPenaltiesApply' and have Module class set it<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1) apply all skill bonuses to ship, module, and charge attributes<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - these should be applied when boarding a ship, unapplied when leaving a ship<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - when leaving a ship, all modifiers should be reapplied to base attributes w/o skill modifiers<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(2) apply module and rig bonuses and modifiers to ship, module or charge attributes all together<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; this means all percentage increases are added together then the final sum percent is applied<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the attribute. &nbsp;when modules are added/removed or skill level changes happen, the whole<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; process needs to be undone for the current configuration (current modifier value) then the new<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; modifier value needs to be calculated from all appliable skills and modules<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *** this final modifier is applied on top of all previous embedded modifiers<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - these should be applied/unapplied when modules/rigs are fitted/unfitted and remain<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;even when a player leaves a ship, BUT if a player with insufficient skills for some or all<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;fitted modules/rigs, they should be offlined and their modifiers unapplied<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(3) apply implant bonuses on top of all other embedded modifiers<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(4) Module Manager must keep track of all attribute modifiers applied as a result of an external<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;effect, such as a module from hostile ship. &nbsp;These modifiers are kept in their own map<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at the MM level and applied to the ship attributes AFTER ALL other moodifier levels are applied<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We need some API functions in the MM that allow a hostile entity's MM to call in order to<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;register aand de-register these modifiers. &nbsp;NOTE that any of these modifiers are also subject<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to stacking penalties where multiple sources of modifiers are affecting the same attribute.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** example: Stabber w/ Overdrive Injector System I, Medium Auxiliary Thrusters I, Minmatar Cruiser skill to level 2, Slot 6: Eifyr and Co. 'Rogue' CY-1<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (0) base velocity of stabber = 231 m/s<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) aggregate and apply skill &nbsp;bonuses: L2 * 5% = 10% ---&gt; 254 m/s<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) aggregate and apply module bonuses:10.4% ---&gt; 280.5 m/s<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) aggregate and apply rig bonuses: 10% + (7.25% * 87% stack penalty) --&gt; 298.5 m/s<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (4) aggregate and apply implant bonuses: 3% ---&gt; 307 m/s<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*** example: Maller w/ Adaptive Nano Plating I, Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane I, Amarr Cruiser Lv 3, Medium Anti-Explosive Pump I rig<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (0) base explosive resistance of Maller = 20% from 1 - 0.8 resonance<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (1) aggregate and apply skill bonuses: L3 * 5% = 15% ---&gt; 32% from 1 - 0.8 * (100% - 15%)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (2) aggregate and apply module bonuses: 1% ---&gt; 32.7% from 1 - 0.8 * (100% - 15%) *<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (100% - 1%)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (3) aggregate and apply rig bonuses: <br/>
<br/>
* STUDY: Examine the ModuleAttributeChangeComponent class, determine how it works. &nbsp;Then figure out how it should be used in ::Process() to bring about attribute changes due to effects applied based on the current module state.PassiveModule<br/>
* work on implementing Power Grid and CPU checking Before 'approving' module to go Online<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- check power and cpu available against required<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- if both check out, then apply power and cpu reductions to ship attributes<br/>
* work on implementing application of effects onto ship attributes when module is Onlined<br/>
* work on implementing removal of effects from ship attributes when module is Offlined<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- this includes restorration to the ship's power and cpu attributes<br/>
* how do we maintain the ship and each modulesttributes unmodified by skill bonuses?<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;- MAYBE WE DON'T? &nbsp;JUST SAVE THEM TO THE DATABASE, AND DE-EMBED THEM WHEN YOU DISEMBARK A SHIP<br/>
* implement new code to handle' base a setting the target object for the effect<br/>
* implement new code to handle applying the effect during the designated module state<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;1) effects that go active in ACTIVE state will REMAIN in effect in OVERLOAD as well<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;2) we use some 'nullifyOnlineEffect' indicator tomark those effects that go active in ONLINE to reverse them when the module goes into ACTIVE<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;3) any effect that goes active in ONLINE without a corresponding effect for ACTIVE or OVERLOAD that has nullifyOnlineEffect set will remain active in ALL THREE states<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ when entering a module state of online, activate, or overload check for effects with that state<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; assigned to them then process those effects upon entering that state<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ effects marked with ONLINE are processed only once when module enters ONLINE state and<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are reversed when module enters OFFLINE state<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ effects marked with ACTIVE_MAINTAIN are processed each cycle of a module in the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ACTIVATED state but are NOT applied in any cummulative way, just maintaining the target<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; attributes in their new values<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the effect on target attributes will reverse once when the module finally transitions out of the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ACTIVATED state, because when Deactivate is called on a module, it immediately enters the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DEACTIVATING state and remains there until the cycle timer expires, then goes to ONLINE<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; state. &nbsp;In the DEACTIVATING state, ONLY when cycle timer expires, all effects active in the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ACTIVATED state are reversed and the state immediately transitions to the ONLINE state<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ effects marked with ACTIVE_CONSUME are processed each cycle of a module in the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ACTIVATED state and are applied in a way such that the target attributes are affected in <br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a cummulative manner, such as capacitor charge depleting a set amount for each cycle<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- the effect will stop making cummulative changes to the target attributes when the module<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transitions out of the ACTIVATED state and into the DEACTIVATING state (following same<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; behavior as for ACTIVE_MAINTAIN)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ effects marked with OVERLOAD are processed when the module enters the OVERLOAD state.<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these effects are modifiers of effects marked as ACTIVE_MAINTAIN or ACTIVE_CONSUME<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and these ACTIVE_xxxxx effects are made active along with OVERLOAD effects when entering<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the OVERLOADED state<br/>

* DESTINY: warping does not check for capacitor need per AU or w/e, and does not subtract<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; capacitor charge from capacitor when warp is initiated (enters phase during which STOP will<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; not work)<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ this needs to be a public call to the Ship class to inform warp is pending and pass in the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; distance in AU, then determine how much cap charge to consume, apply that to ship's cap<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; charge, then return the fraction of the warp that can proceed (0.0 to 1.0) based on how much<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cap charge was available<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;+ warpCapacitorNeed (153) has units of capacitor unit gigajoule per kg per AU<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- so, calculate gigajoules by product of mass, warp distance in AU, and this attribute,<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and if there is insufficient capacitor charge on the ship, then empty it to zero and calculate<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the fraction of available charge over the cap need for whole warp distance, then multiply<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; that fraction by the whole warp distance and calculate then partial warp sending that to the<br/>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; client along with the error about insufficient cap charge for warp (packet log for this error)<br/>
* choose an enum value in calculation type enum to make reverse calculation in the dgmEffectsInfo table and in the Effects code mean that the server automatically sets the reverse calculation type. &nbsp;otherwise, use the reverse calculation type loaded from the DB table dgmEffectsInfo<br/>
* EXPAND: Charges do have effects, so the Module Component that manages charges for the Active Modules that use charges will need an instance of the Effects container / manager class<br/>
<br/>
* QUICK: Future-proof use of ModuleManager for POS structures in groupIDs in categoryID = 23 and celestial groupIDs = 336, but there are a bunch of guns in entity categoryID with groupID = 383, 180, 99 that have no attributes, but have a couple effects (how does the server know which weapon effect and damage to apply? -- going to have to packet log high-sec sentry guns firing, and mission and anomaly/signature sites guns firing<br/>
